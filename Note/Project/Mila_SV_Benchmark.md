### Motivation
1. Mila sent us several samples and there are some SVs should be contained by all these samples.
2. Mila want to address the issue why these SVs did not report in callset.
3. These SVs are very important for her research project.

### Purpose (CGR)
1. Find a way to call these missing SVs
2. Explain why these SVs were missing 
3. Build a benchmark to create a guaidline to let people know 
   * how to choose parameters
   * how to choose aligners
   * how to choose SV callsers

### Prgress 
1. Finished
   * Find a way to call these missing SVs
   * Explain why these SVs were missing
   * The testing by using
     *  Different caller
     *  Different aligner
     *  Different parameters
2. TBD
    * Summarize the guaidline
